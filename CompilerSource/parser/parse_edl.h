/**
  @file parse_edl.h
  @brief Header laying out the API of the EDL parser.
  
  This file declares an extension of JDI's AST class for parsing and storing EDL.
  The parse process is divided into two passes.
  
  In the first pass, the AST is built and basic syntax checking is done in the
  process. Declarations are handled, and function/variable names are recorded
  in the local \c scope_harvest structure. ASTs generated by JDI are combed for
  function parameter counts. Overload verification is not handled here, as this
  behavior is specific to the host language language. Enumeration constants are
  evaluated as they are encountered.
  
  During the second pass, switch() statements are checked, and dot-accesses are
  coerced and optimized. Unoptimized dot accesses are listed
