/**
 * @file lex_cpp.h
 * @brief Header extending the \c lexer base class for parsing C++.
 *
 * This file defines two subclasses of \c jdi::lexer. The first is meant to lex
 * C++ definitions, and so returns a wide range of token types. It will also do
 * any needed preprocessing, handing the second lexer to \c jdi::AST to handle
 * `#if` expression evaluation. The second lexer is much simpler, and treats all
 * identifiers the same.

  /**
  Basic lexing/preprocessing unit; polled by all systems for tokens.

  This lexer calls out to `read_token` to handle phases 1-3 of translation.
  It then handles phases four (execution of preprocessing directives), five
  (expansion of string literals), and six (concatenation of adjacent string
  literals). This work needs to be handled when parsing C++11 or greater, as
  string literal contents can be used at compile time to have meaningful
  effect on output (this was also possible in previous versions, but through
  less conventional means that would not normally arise).

  Because of that nuance, and the general lookahead-heavy nature of parsing C++,
  token rewinding is a first-class feature of this lexer. When a string literal
  is encountered, another token is read immediately, and is either queued for
  return or concatenated to the current literal (depending on whether it is also
  a string literal). There is also a RAII helper, `look_ahead`, designed to
  facilitate handling of cases such as MVP. This way, a try-like branch of code
  can attempt to evaluate the tree one way, then seamlessly give up and allow
  a later branch to attempt the same.

  Thus, this lexer implementation has four layers of token source data:
    1. The open file stack. Files or string buffers (managed by an llreader) are
       lexed for raw tokens.
    2. Macros used within a file are expanded into tokens, and these buffers of
       tokens are stacked. Per ISO, a macro may not appear twice in this stack.
    3. Rewind operations produce queues of tokens. Each queue is stacked.
    4. During normal lexing operations, minor lookahead may be required.
       Tokens read during lookahead are queued at the top of this stack.d

  The above stacks are treated in stack order. They are generally populated in
  order from 1-4, but tokens are retrieved in order of 4-1.
