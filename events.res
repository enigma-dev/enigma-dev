# This file contains a list of all events in ENIGMA and the order in which they are executed.
#
# By "contains," I actually mean to imply "dictates." This file will let you re-order events,
#	change the behavior of existing events, and even define new events with new behaviours,
#	so long as the IDE supports adding them.
#
# That said, DO NOT MODIFY THE CONTENTS OF THIS FILE, UNLESS YOU HAVE READ THE DOCUMENTATION.
# Modifying this file CAN screw up ENIGMA's behavior.
