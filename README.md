"**STIGMA**" is a recursive acronym, which stands for, "**S**tigma **I**s **N**ot a **G**ame **M**aker **A**ugmentation"...

...that actually spells "**SINGMA**", because we are not very good at coming up with acronyms...

A fork of the ENIGMA Development Environment that strives to go a different direction than that of the software it stemmed from, in hopes to provide a much more stable and appealing game dev software for desktop platorms.
