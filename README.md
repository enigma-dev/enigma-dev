# STIGMA Development Environment

A fork of the ENIGMA Development Environment that strives to go a different direction than that of the software it stemmed from, in hopes to provide a much more stable and appealing game dev software for desktop platorms.

Special thanks to the original authors, most notably among them:

- Josh Ventura
- Robert B. Colton
- Greg Williamson
