Description: A Windows port of the "Tiny File Dialogs" Widget System's set of functions. It doesn't use any of Tiny File Dialog's original source code; this was written as a separate project, from a different author, to make all the same functions available for Windows, while giving the same look and feel of GameMaker to about half of the functions.
