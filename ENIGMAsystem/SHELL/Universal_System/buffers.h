 * - The number of inactive objects
 * - The inactive objects themselves
 * - A header byte for the @c enigma::backgrounds @c AssetArray
 * - @c enigma::backgrounds itself
 * - A footer byte for the @c enigma::backgrounds @c AssetArray
 * - The current room index
 * - A SHA1-checksum
 *
 * The serialization for objects works in the following manner: for each class in the object hierarchy, a leading byte
 * is emitted to identify the object and verify that the data following it is valid. The bytes are written as follows:
 * - @c object_basic : @c 0xAA
 * - @c object_planar : @c 0xAB
 * - @c object_timelines : @c 0xAC
 * - @c object_graphics : @c 0xAD
 * - @c object_transform : @c 0xAE
 * - @c object_collisions : @c 0xAF
 * - Any user defined object : @c 0xBB
 *
 * These leading bytes are then followed by the data of each class. While the data that is serialized for the inner
 * classes does not change over time in terms of the contained variables, modifications to the user defined objects can
 * lead to generation of classes whose contents do not remain stable over time.
 *
 * To ensure backwards compatibility of previously saved game state with a future revision of the user-defined object, a
 * symbol table is emitted before each object's data block which maps the name of the serialized variable to the offset
 * from the end of the symbol table where its data is stored. On the C++ side, the compiler emits a table for every
 * object which maps the name of each variable in the object to a function which is responsible for deserializing its
 * state from a byte stream. Then, the intersection of these two tables are taken at runtime, which gives the set of
 * variables that exist both in the current revision of the object and the one serialized as part of the older game state,
 * along with deserialization routines for each variable.
 *
 * As a proof of concept of implementing serialization and deserialization for an object type, the required routines are
 * defined for the @c AssetArray and the @c Background classes to allow serializing and deserializing <tt> enigma::backgrounds </tt>,
 * which is a <tt> AssetArray<Background> </tt>. The methods are:
 * - <tt> std::size_t byte_size() const noexcept </tt> - Get the size (in bytes) of the object
 * - <tt> std::vector<std::size_t> serialize() </tt> - Serialize the object into a byte stream
 * - <tt> std::size_t deserialize_self(std::byte *iter) </tt> - Deserialize @c this from the byte stream and return the
 *                                                              total number of bytes read
 * - <tt> static std::pair<std::size_t, T> deserialize(std::byte *iter) - Deserialize an object from the given byte stream
 *                                                                        and return it along with its size
 *
 * Out of these four, @c byte_size() and @c deserialize() are automatically picked up by the routines defined in
 * @c serialization.h . The other methods have to be detected at compile time by the caller, using code like the following:
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * if constexpr (has_serialize_method_v<T>) {
 *   for (std::size_t i = 0; i < assets_.size(); i++) {
 *     std::vector<std::byte> serialized = assets_[i].serialize();
 *     // ...
 *   }
 * } else if constexpr (HAS_SERIALIZE_FUNCTION()) {
 *   for (std::size_t i = 0; i < assets_.size(); i++) {
 *     enigma::enigma_internal_serialize(operator[](i), len, result);
 *     // ...
 *   }
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Both of the functions used in the <tt> if constexpr </tt> blocks are defined in @c detect_serialization.h . The first
 * one, <tt> has_serialize_method_v<T> </tt>, checks if the object has a method of the form <tt> object.serialize() </tt>
 * following the type given before. The second one, <tt> HAS_SERIALIZE_FUNCTION() </tt>, checks if the <tt> enigma::serialize </tt>
 * function is invocable with the object's type. Together, these allow handling both cases of <tt> object.serialize() </tt>
 * and <tt> serialize(object) </tt>.
 *
 * After all the state is serialized, the SHA-1 checksum of the buffer's data is calculated and written at the end.
 *
 * An example of the serialized state may look like the following:

 * @brief Load previously saved state from a buffer
 *
 * This function firstly checks the checksum of the buffer's data. If it matches the checksum written at the end of the
 * buffer, it proceeds with deserializing the state written in the buffer. Before deserializing anything, however,
 * it clears the active and inactive instance lists to avoid issues with clashing object IDs. It then deserializes each
 * object by reading its object index (a unique identifier for each type), and calling the virtual @c deserialize_self()
 * function of the object after using <tt> enigma::instance_create_id </tt> to create the specific object type. After
 * checking the header of the <tt> enigma::backgrounds </tt> data, it reads that as well and verifies the footer. Finally,
 * it reads the room index and calls <tt> enigma::room_goto </tt> with the index.
