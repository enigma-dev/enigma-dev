/*
 * This file defines functions for working with the GIF format (currently only loading).
 * Since GIF is a somewhat polarizing format, here's a few salient points:
 *  1) If someone tells you that "GIF is patented", they are 100% wrong. Politely point
 *     them at the standard; it's just a wrapper format: (http://www.w3.org/Graphics/GIF/spec-gif89a.txt)
 *  2) If someone tells you taht "GIF uses LZW, which is patented", they are correct, but
 *     their information is out-dated. All relevant LZW patents have now expired.
