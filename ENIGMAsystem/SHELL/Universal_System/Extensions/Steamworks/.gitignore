# public/ & redistributable_bin/ directories contains the necessary headers & libraries for interfacing with 
# Steamworks API and we need to keep any file inside it because we need to test any new release before letting 
# game developers use it and by definition we need to keep the old tested libraries which means game developers 
# don't have to download Steamworks SDK.
