# ENIGMA's Steamworks Extension

Steamworks is a set of tools and services that help game developers and publishers build their games and get the most out of distributing on Steam.
This extension was part of [Google Summer of Code 2023 project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/projects/kHDskccO). Reach out to
me on ENIGMA's official Discord server.

## Supported Platforms

 - Ubuntu Linux.

## Building Steamworks Extension

### Ubuntu Linux 64-bit

1. Download [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/download).
2. Download [Steamworks SDK v158a](https://partner.steamgames.com/downloads/steamworks_sdk_158a.zip).
3. Unzip the Steamworks SDK.
4. Copy the `redistributable_bin/` directory to `enigma-dev/ENIGMAsystem/SHELL/Universal_System/Extensions/Steamworks/gameclient/steambinder/Steamv158a/sdk/`.
5. [An alternative to step 4] Set the `STEAM_SDK_PATH` environment variable to the path of the `sdk/` directory in your unzipped Steamworks SDK by appending this line inside `.bashrc`.
```bash
cd ~
```
```bash
vim .bashrc
```
```bash
export STEAM_SDK_PATH=/path/to/steamworks/sdk
```
6. Find the path to your `gameoverlayrenderer.so` file:
```bash
find ~ -name gameoverlayrenderer.so
```
7. Now modify the `.bashrc` again and append these two lines (DON'T forget to change the path to your `gameoverlayrenderer.so` file):
 - 64-bit
```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/Desktop/enigma-dev/ENIGMAsystem/SHELL/Universal_System/Extensions/Steamworks/gameclient/steambinder/Steamv158a/sdk/redistributable_bin/linux64:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

export LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/ubuntu12_64/gameoverlayrenderer.so:${LD_PRELOAD}
```
 - 32-bit
```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/Desktop/enigma-dev/ENIGMAsystem/SHELL/Universal_System/Extensions/Steamworks/gameclient/steambinder/Steamv158a/sdk/redistributable_bin/linux32:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

export LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/ubuntu12_32/gameoverlayrenderer.so:${LD_PRELOAD}
```
8. Enable the Steamworks and Json extensions inside the IDE (LGM/RGM).
9. Run the demo to make sure everything is working fine `enigma-dev/ENIGMAsystem/SHELL/Universal_System/Extensions/Steamworks/steamworks_demo/demo.project.gmx`.

### Windows 64-bit

```
Note: Windows support will be postponed due to an ABI issue as ENIGMA doesn't support MSVC yet, I recommend using Ubuntu Linux - 20/06/2023 00:45
```

```
Note: Currently, the Steam Binder doesn't support Windows.
```

1. Download [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/download).
2. Download [Steamworks SDK v158a](https://partner.steamgames.com/downloads/steamworks_sdk_158a.zip).
3. Unzip the Steamworks SDK.
4. Copy the `redistributable_bin\` directory to `enigma-dev\ENIGMAsystem\SHELL\Universal_System\Extensions\Steamworks\gameclient\steambinder\Steamv158a\sdk\`.
5. [An alternative to step 4] Set the `STEAM_SDK_PATH` environment variable to the path of the `sdk` directory in your unzipped Steamworks SDK (Note that if you used this step, you will have to run LGM/RGM from the same terminal):
```bash
STEAM_SDK_PATH="\path\to\steamworks\sdk"
```
6. Copy the `steam_api64.dll` from `enigma-dev\ENIGMAsystem\SHELL\Universal_System\Extensions\Steamworks\gameclient\steambinder\Steamv158a\sdk\redistributable_bin\win64\` and then paste it into `C:\msys64\tmp\` directory. This must be done as LGM exports the executable in that location and we need that DLL to be with the executable.
7. Enable the Steamworks and Json extensions inside the IDE (LGM/RGM).
8. Run the demo to make sure everything is working fine `enigma-dev\ENIGMAsystem\SHELL\Universal_System\Extensions\Steamworks\steamworks_demo\demo.project.gmx`.

   -  `Steamworks/gameclient/steambinder/SteamvXXX/` and `Steamworks/gameclient/steambinder/SteamFake/` is the 1st layer of the 
      extension. It is the Steamworks SDK.
   -  `Steamworks/steambinder/` is the 2nd layer of the extension. It contains the code that binds the Steamworks SDK to the extension.
   -  `Steamworks/gameclient/` is the 3rd layer of the extension. It contains the code that is directly calls the Steamworks API functions.
   -  `Steamworks/` is the 4th layer of the extension. It is the extension itself. 
   -  Anything outside of `Steamworks` is considered part of the 5th layer that depends on Steamworks' extension.

```

## Steamworks Extension's Shared Resources Handling

Steamworks extension writes to `posted_async_events` queue inside `Platforms/General/PFmain.h` using Async callbacks
while the main game loop is reading the same shared queue.

These are my critical sections:
 - `Steamworks/leaderboards.cpp` inside `enigma::push_create_leaderboard_steam_async_event()` function.
 - `Steamworks/leaderboards.cpp` inside `enigma::push_leaderboard_upload_steam_async_event()` function.
 - `Steamworks/leaderboards.cpp` inside `enigma::push_leaderboard_download_steam_async_event()` function.

## Integrating New Version of Steamworks SDK

 1. Create a new version directory inside `Steamworks/gameclient/steambinder/`,
 2. Download the new version of Steamworks SDK and extract it.
 3. Copy `sdk/` directory to `Steamworks/gameclient/steambinder/SteamvXXX/`.
 4. Modify `STEAMWORKS_API_VERSION` variable inside `Steamworks/Makefile` to point to the newer Steamworks SDK.
 5. Modify `Steamworks/gameclient/steambinder/steambinder.h` to point to the newer Steamworks SDK interfaces.
 6. [Skip this step] Modify `Steamworks/CMakelists.txt` to point to the newer Steamworks SDK.
 7. Update the version link in the [Building Steamworks Extension](#building-steamworks-extension).
 8. Run the demo to make sure everything is working fine.

## Incompatibility with GMS

| Incompatibility | ENIGMA | GMS | Notes | Breaks code? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ``steam_activate_overlay_user`` function definition | steam_activate_overlay_user(int dialog, int64 steamid); | steam_activate_overlay_user(string dialog_name, int64 steamid); | dialog constants: `user_ov_steamid`, `user_ov_chat`, `user_ov_jointrade`, `user_ov_stats`, `user_ov_achievements`, `user_ov_friendadd`, `user_ov_friendremove`, `user_ov_friendrequestaccept`, and `user_ov_friendrequestignore` | Yes |
| Maximum leaderboard entries: ``lb_max_entries`` | The user can set | - | - | No |
| ``steam_set_rich_presence`` function return type | Returns ``bool`` | Returns ``void`` | - | No |
