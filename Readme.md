# Welcome to the STIGMA Development Environment!

**STIGMA, the Sexually Transmitted Infection of Game Making Assholes.**

The name of this is just a light-hearted joke, please don't get butthurt...

A fork of the ENIGMA Development Environment that strives to build a much friendlier community than the one formed around the original software it stemmed from, and do a significantly better job at delivering a stable and quality free software with features added that developers actually want, in great numbers, in places such as the GameMaker Community. From Shell and Process Execution, to Video Playback, and improved UTF-8 support on Windows, we at stigma prefer to actually listen to what game developers want, not what we feel is best on our own out of being narrow-minded. Build games that a GameMaker compatible (within reason) and without the need to pay a dime, and with support for new platforms like FreeBSD and DragonFly BSD. Focussed completely on desktop development, and not biting off more than we can chew, which is an area of concern small teams often fail to care about. I left the ENIGMA project because I want to develop software without being sucked into petty arguments about stupid things, which is all the ENIGMA community ever does if you care to read their Discord server and/or IRC backlog, it's insane. Game developers want to develop games, not argue politics or religion, and this is why the ENIGMA commmunity has been a hindrance to me, they only talked about such things among other problems such as refusing to collaborate in ways that are healthy.
