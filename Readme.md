ENIGMA, the Extensible Non-Interpreted Game Maker Augmentation, is an open-source, cross-platform game development environment based on the popular software, Game Maker. Its intent is to provide users with a quality game creation tool and a bridge between high- and low-level programming languages. It can be used either through an IDE, such as its sister project, [LateralGM](https://github.com/IsmAvatar/LateralGM), or its up-and-coming custom frontend, [RadialGM](https://github.com/enigma-dev/RadialGM), or also through its command line interface, [emake](CommandLine/emake).

Like Game Maker, ENIGMA comprises an easy to use Drag & Drop system as well as its own programming language. This programming language, known as EDL, is essentially a mix between C++ and Game Maker's GML. Part of ENIGMA's goal is to remain backward-compatible with Game Maker, serving for some intents and purposes as a Game Maker compiler. However, EDL offers many very powerful features which simply aren't present in the alternative. Such features include the ability to compile DLLs and other C/C++ scripts right into the program, and direct access to C++ types, templates, and functions.

Although EDL adopts GML's very lax syntax in its scripting, the inputted code is actually parsed and translated into valid C++. This compilation improves size and performance of the language by incredible amounts, while almost magically maintaining its simplicity of use.
